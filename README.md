# Blog98
Blog98 has two pages first page which is home page has all the 10 blogs and by clicking each blog it would direct you to the webpage of the blog you clicked.
This app gets it's data from Json file located inside of "assets/data/blog.json".
These data got parse from Google news tab with using ParseHub software.
All these code being done with Flutter using Android Studio also this app has a IOS widget that just shows the time, for that I had to use Swift XCode since 
Flutter doesn't have this feature yet.

# What I Learned
Json, ParseHub, Android Studio, IOS widget, Swift XCode, and Flutter
